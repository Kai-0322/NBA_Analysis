# Project-1
# Who is the greatest scorer of all time

# Our definition of best will be based on points initially.
- We isolate the top ten scorers/season and compare to the league average points/player/season
- Calculate how many standard deviations are they away from the average
Then are points the best variable to determine the best results?
- The biggest reason we are going off of points scored is that is the best corelation to winning.

# Which variable is better correlated with wins?
- Run a Pearson Correlation test on all variables to determine which one is most likely to predict a win.
- Filter the data by games that were "won" and then run the corr() function
Is the conclusion for the test points?

# If it isnâ€™t:
Based on the above finding, which ten players are performing above the league average in that category?
- Graph the individual averages for top ten players against the averages for the league.
- Calculate average win/loss ratio for league
- Compare with win/loss ratio for the top ten players

# It it is:
Do the players that score higher than average points also have a higher than average win ratio?
- calculate top ten player win/loss ratio per season
- compare that with the league average win/loss per season

# What did we learn
- Initially we wanted to directly compare two athletes we felt were considered to the the best basketball players of all time
- upon concluding and going over the many statistics we compiled it became evident that it wasn't truly possible to have one true GOAT
- it was too close to definitivly make a call based on data alone because it was a perfect split statisctically
- This was a great lesson because we both needed to widen and narrow our vison to come to a final conclusion.
- widen in a sense that we needed to find more players than just the two we compared to truly find the best scorer
- and narrow in a sense of making sure that we were soley focused on the stats that win games.

# Resources
- Our Dataset used for pulling all of our information to make this project possible was from basketball-reference.com
- Utilized AI to help with our more complex visualizations.
