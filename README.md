# Project-1
# Who is the greatest scorer of all time

# Which variable is better correlated with wins?
- Run a Pearson Correlation test on all variables to determine which one is most likely to predict a win.
- Filter the data by games that were "won" and then run the corr() function
- The conclusion was points!

# Our definition of best will be based on points because of its high correlation with winning.
- We isolate the top five scorers/season and compare to the league average points/player/season
- Calculate how many standard deviations are they away from the average

# What did we learn
- Initially we wanted to directly compare two athletes we felt were considered to the the best basketball players of all time
- upon concluding and going over the many statistics we compiled it became evident that we needed to design our analysis with fewer assumptions.
- It was too close to definitivly make a call based on data alone because it was a perfect split statisctically
- This was a great lesson because we both needed to widen and narrow our vison to come to a final conclusion.
- Widen in a sense that we needed to find more players than just the two we compared to truly find the best scorer,
- and narrow in a sense of making sure that we were soley focused on the stats that win games.

# Resources
- Our Dataset used for pulling all of our information to make this project possible was from basketball-reference.com
- Utilized AI to help with our more complex visualizations.
